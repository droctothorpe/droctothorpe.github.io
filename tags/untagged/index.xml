      <description>After receiving a Rubikâ€™s cube for free at KubeCon NA, I decided to teach my six year old daughter how to solve them, but first, I had to teach myself.
It took approximately 2 hours of watching Youtube videos to learn. Around half of that time was spent finding a tutorial that didn&amp;rsquo;t suck.
I taught my daughter over the course of a few evenings. She picked it up like a baws and impresses the heck out of people with it.</description>

      <description>I attend too many a lot of demos.
Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve observed that engineers have a tendency to jump into complex solutions without providing sufficient context first.
When confronted with this approach, audiences often disengage, especially people leaders who can be several steps removed from technical implementation details.
It&amp;rsquo;s frustrating to see a great solution not get the reaction it deserves.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing. Generally speaking, people have a low tolerance for complexity.</description>
