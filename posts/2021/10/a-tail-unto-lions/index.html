<p>&hellip;be a tail unto lions, and not a head unto foxes.</p>
<p>&ndash; Ethics of our Fathers, 4:15</p>

<p>I heard a remarkable anecdote on a podcast the other day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Admired for her beauty, Jennie Jerome (Winston Churchill’s mother) glided
through the loftiest social circles in Great Britain. Once, on consecutive
nights, Ms. Jerome dined with England’s premier politicians: Prime Minister
Benjamin Disraeli and his chief rival, William Gladstone. When questioned
about her impressions of the two men, Ms. Jerome made the following
observation:</p>
<p>“When I left the dining room after sitting next to Gladstone, I thought he was
the cleverest man in England. But when I sat next to Disraeli I left feeling
that I was the cleverest woman.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several days after hearing this, I participated in a meeting with two managers who could not
more effectively exemplify the contrast between these two approaches. Since
then, I&rsquo;ve made a concerted effort to adopt the Disraeli approach, and it&rsquo;s been
nothing short of revelatory.</p>
<p>For example, in a recent meeting, two brilliant teammates engaged in a prolonged
discussion about whether to write an API in Python or Golang. They both provided
excellent justifications despite taking opposing and increasingly entrenched
positions. Finally, one of them addressed me as a resident senior engineer and
asked what I thought about the Python vs Go debate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could go either way because I&rsquo;m equally terrible at both,&rdquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed and I could feel the tension evaporate.</p>
<p>It feels good to play that kind of role on a team. It feels good to promote down
to earth collaboration, to wear my ignorance on my sleeve and demonstrate, by
example, that it&rsquo;s okay to not know things. It feels good to work hard, but
laugh, particularly at myself. At the end of the day, if we&rsquo;re not having fun,
then we&rsquo;re doing something wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with people who have made me feel brilliant and people who have made
me feel dumb, so I know what it&rsquo;s like to be on both sides of that equation. I&rsquo;d
like to be the kind of person who makes others feel brilliant.</p>
<p>Being a dipstick helps.</p>
