      <p>I attend <del>too many</del> a lot of demos.</p>
<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve observed that engineers have a tendency to jump into
complex solutions without providing sufficient context first.</p>
<p>When confronted with this approach, audiences often disengage, especially people
leaders who can be several steps removed from technical implementation
details.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating to see a great solution not get the reaction it deserves.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing. Generally speaking, people have a low tolerance for
complexity. Senior people leaders, in particular, are already drinking from a
firehose and often struggling to somehow tame and orchestrate an overwhelming
level of complexity.</p>
<p>The key to making complexity engaging is justification. If you take a few
minutes at the start of your demo to justify the subsequent complexity, your
audience will be significantly more tolerant and perhaps even genuinely
interested.</p>
<p>How do you justify complexity? It&rsquo;s simple. Start your demos by addressing the
following question:</p>
<p><strong>What problem are you trying to solve?</strong></p>
<p>WPAYTTS.</p>
<p>Someone should make silicone bracelets with that or something.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a directly proportional relationship between (1) how effectively and comprehensively you describe the
problem, and (2) how interested in the solution (and willing to to grapple with complexity) your
audience is.</p>
<p>Demos are often time-constrained. Sometimes you have to cut corners. Do not cut
this one. Always describe the problem.</p>
<p>You can provide additional details downstream. If you&rsquo;ve adequately justified
the solution by describing the severity of the problem it&rsquo;s intended to address,
people will inquire about implementation details organically.</p>
<p>You can use this simple outline as a starting point:</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem</li>
<li>The solution</li>
<li>The impact</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of demos I attend spend 95% of their allotted time on the solution.
A distribution that approaches an even split between these three phases will
often be more effective.</p>
<p>I often engage in RDD, rage-driven development (as opposed to resume-driven
development). Consequently, I tend to be <em>intimately</em> familiar with (and furious
about), the <em>problem</em>. I find complaining about it at length to a more or less
captive (and interested) audience oddly cathartic, and there&rsquo;s no better way to
whet their appetites for a solution.</p>
