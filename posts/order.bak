## Order of magnitude

I recently looked at an engineering resume that had a superfluous space at the
start of one of the first paragraph. I immediately set it down. 

Why? 

A million line application can fail to start because of a single extra space.

Programming is pedantry.

It's not so much that the devil is in the details as it is that providence is in
the particulars. 

Precision can be an aesthetic experience. In my experience, you either have an
appreciation for it or you don't. In that sense, it's a talent rather than a
knowledge or skill that you can acquire.

A good litmus test for it is how you react to images like this one:

For some, it's silly. For other's, it's sublime. 

It's interesting to note that we don't really have a more specific term for this
category of person beyond "organized," which has much broader connotations. 

Well, there's "anal retentive" (thanks for nothing, Freud) and the misused
"OCD," both of which are derogatory. 

Let's make one up. 

Pedants? Heh. That's derogatory too, I guess.
